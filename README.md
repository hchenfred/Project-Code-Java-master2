# Project3
Design an AI agent to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices problems.

RPM (Raven’s progressive matrix) is a geometric problem used for intelligence test. The problem we are facing is to design a knowledge-based AI agent that mimics human cognition to solve RPM problems.

Project 3 is the continuation of project 1 and project 2 to design an AI agent to solve RPM (Raven’s Progressive Matrices) problems. In project 1, I used verbal representation only. In project 2, I approached problems with visual representation to solve problem set C. Project 3 will be focused on solving problem set D and E with visual representation only. Problem set D and E are all 3x3 RPM problems.
